# Contributing to gazeanalysislib

First off, thanks for contributing!

The following is a guideline for contributing to this project in a way that keeps the project in good condition, simple and fun.

### What is the idea of the project?
The idea is to build a good and easy to use library that provides tools for easy gazedata analysis.
The community is invited to participate in the development.

### How can I contribute?
* Send a bug report
* Fix a bug and make a pull request
* Program a feature and send a pull request to possibly include your feature to gazeanalysislib
* Open a conversation
* Improve documentation or make examples

### What are our guidelines
* Use only english everywhere
* Comment your code
* Don't include any user-specific information or content such as filenames, pathnames, temporary files etc,
  everything needs to be parametrizable (examples are an exception)
* Keep commit messages short and informative: max 80 characters and one line
* Keep your code clean and do not make any extra lines that are unnecessary, use pep8-styling as much as it is applicable to
  Matlab
* Respect others

Our development strategy is to make github-releases once a while when new features and/or bug fixes have been completed.
The scripts build with gazeanalysislib are kept in different repositories.
